<p>Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, usually shortened to Porsche (German pronunciation: [ˈpɔʁʃə] ⓘ; see below), is a German automobile manufacturer specializing in luxury, high-performance sports cars, SUVs and sedans, headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The company is owned by Volkswagen AG, a controlling stake of which is owned by Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Porsche's current lineup includes the 718, 911, Panamera, Macan, Cayenne and Taycan.

    The origins of the company date to the 1930s when Czech-German automotive engineer Ferdinand Porsche founded Porsche[5] with Adolf Rosenberger, a keystone figure in the creation of German automotive manufacturer and Audi precursor Auto Union,[6] and Austrian businessman Anton Piëch, who was, at the time, also Ferdinand Porsche's son in law. In its early days, it was contracted by the German government to create a vehicle for the masses, which later became the Volkswagen Beetle.[7] After World War II, when Ferdinand, a member of both the Nazi Party and the SS, would be arrested for war crimes, his son Ferry Porsche, an SS volunteer, began building his own car, which would result in the Porsche 356.
    
    In 2009, Porsche entered an agreement with Volkswagen to create an 'integrated working group' by merging the two companies' car manufacturing operations.[8][9] By 2015, Porsche SE, the holding company spun off from the original Porsche firm, had a controlling interest in the Volkswagen Group, which included Audi and Lamborghini as subsidiaries.[10]
    
    History
    Origin
    Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH"[5] with Adolf Rosenberger[11] and Anton Piëch in 1931.[12] The name is short for Ferdinand Porsche's full title in German, Doktor Ingenieur honoris causa lit. 'Doctor of Engineering, Honorary Degree' Ferdinand Porsche.[13] The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.[14] Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting,[5] but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen.[5] This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time.[7] Later, the Porsche 64 would be developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.[5]</p>
